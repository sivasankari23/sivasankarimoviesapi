Listing page of movies using the OMDB API
1. We can Add a search box to search for movies (search by whatever the API supports, name, year, genre etc)

2. When the user presses the search button it should redirect to a new page which shows the relevant details of the movie

3. If the search doesn't match anything then show relevant error message

4. Show past 5 recent searches, each recent search should be a link to the relevant details page
